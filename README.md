# flake

**What flake does:**

- Flake is a full stack application that allows users to generate different excuses for events they just d o n ' t want to attend. We've all been there... Flake integrates several technologies to let its users use randomly generated excuses based on severity and even create their own excuses. Once they are happy with the reason to flake, they're given the ability to add them to their "Excuse Calendar" for them to check at any time so they can always keep their story straight.
